        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, our journey began with a heartfelt mission to help families suffering from hunger and poverty. One encounter with a 70-year-old grandmother caring for her four orphaned grandchildren changed everything. That moment ignited a deeper mission: to restore dignity, hope, and a future to those who have none.
